# University Course Management System

A C++ object-oriented implementation of a university course management system. This console application demonstrates key OOP principles including inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation through a practical academic context.

## Features

- **Person Management**: Hierarchical class structure with base Person class and derived Student and Lecturer classes
- **Course Administration**: Register students, track enrollment, and manage course capacity
- **Enrollment Rules**: Enforces university-specific policies (e.g., external student limitations)
- **Interface**: Simple console menu system for interacting with the program

## Implementation Highlights

- Demonstrates proper C++ class design and memory management
- Uses smart pointers for safe object management
- Implements polymorphic behavior through virtual functions

## Usage

The system allows university administrators to:
- Register students for available courses
- View course details and participant information
- Monitor course availability
- Check which courses will be canceled due to low enrollment

## Requirements

- C++11 compiler or newer
- Standard Template Library (STL)
